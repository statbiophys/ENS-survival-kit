# Booking a large room

For large rooms, i.e. rooms used for classes, typically at the third floor, the procedure requires an ENS account.
To get an ENS account see the proper guide in this repo.
To book the room one should log in the intranet of LPENS https://intranet.ens.psl.eu/, then "Comment faire pour" -> "Reserver un salle".
Without an account one can still look at the current booking status of the rooms.
