# Printing instructions
The printer we can use is the big one placed at the end of our corridor (next to the window that looks at the garden).
It can be added to the list of printers of your computer through the URI: `ipp://printer-l2gh.phys.ens.fr`.
Then the driver to install should go under the name of `TOSHIBA e-STUDIO3510c Series`.

## Where to find printing paper
The paper can be asked at the guy in the room GHS107. The room is located at the -1 floor of the GH building.
