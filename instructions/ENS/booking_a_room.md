# Booking a large room

For large rooms, i.e. rooms used for classes, typically at the third floor, the procedure requires an ENS account (to get an ENS account see the [proper guide](ens_credentials-eduroam.md)). To book the room one should log in the [intranet of ENS]( https://intranet.ens.psl.eu/), then "Comment faire pour" -> "Reserver un salle", so [here](https://salles.ens.fr/). NOTE: without an account one can still look at the current booking status of the rooms.
