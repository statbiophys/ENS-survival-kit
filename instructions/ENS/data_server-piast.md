# Data Server : Piast
The great majority of the datasets used by the members of the group are stored in the LPENS server `piast`. The server is just for backups and data storage, no higher level usage is allowed. 

## Personal Folder
To ask for access credentials you have to write to the `Service Informatique` at si@phys.ens.fr. They will create a private directory on the server and they will provide you with a new password, tipically different from the phys.ens one. You can use this private directory to store your data and backups (good practice!).

## Group Folder
To access the folder with the group data move up one directory (`cd ..`) and enter the folder `SHARED`. You can store here all the data supposed to be shared by the other members of the group.
