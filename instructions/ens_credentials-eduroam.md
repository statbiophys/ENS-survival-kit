# ENS university credentials
You need a ENS university account to acces the WiFi eduroam or to prove you are a student in general, e.g. for Spotify, etc. 
This is a different account then the LPENS one and you need to request it specifically to service `assistance-cri@ens.psl.eu`. 

In the email you should 1) write your birth date and 2) yout mobile phone number, plus 3) attach a copy of your ENS card.
They should reply to you with you ENS username and the instructions to acces the WiFi. The password will be sent separetely as a text message.

# eduroam (for laptop)
To access the `eduroam` WiFi you can download the installer at the [page](https://cat.eduroam.org/?idp=274). 
The username and password to use will be
- User: <ENS_username>@ens.psl.eu (not a real e-mail address)
- Password: <ENS_password>

On mac you will also need to specifically allow for a profile to be activeted, in System Preferences, Profiles.
