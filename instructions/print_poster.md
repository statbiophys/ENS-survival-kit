# Print a Poster
In order to print a poster you need to send your pdf file to the `Bureau d’Etudes – Mécanique` (office L070) contacting one between arnaud.leclercq@phys.ens.fr and damien.lebaron@phys.ens.fr (preferably).
## A few important things 
- The poster printing can take some time, so we recommend asking in advance (1-2 days at least). 
- Due to the printing machine it's not possible to print with a non-white background.
- The paper canvas are wider than A0, so the final poster will have white stripes at the edges.
