## Mathematica
To obtain Mathematica got to the page [Service de Prestations Informatiques](https://www.spi.ens.psl.eu/ens/mathematica.html) and look for the procedure under `Licenses home-use`. Note : this can be down only within ENS. 

You will be asked to fill a form with your ENS informations and it will automatically forward the request to the "Correspondant logiciel de l'ENS" for approval. Wait for the e-mail containing the license (it can take also a week), create a Wolfram ID, acces Wolfram User Portal, register the license you just received and download the installer.
