# I am a Newcomer
Yes, we now, it's a lot to digest. 

## The (Theoretical) Minimum
Reach out for the `Resources Humaines` (office L059, e-mail pole-rh@phys.ens.fr) and ask for 

1) your __contract__ (this require a bank account and other amenities, see last section);
2) your __phys.ens__ e-mail address <firstname.lastname>@phys.ens.fr;
3) your __"carte multifunction"__ to enter the ENS buildings (and pay at the university cantine).
EXTRA : it could be smart to ask already for the authorization to access the campus 24h and to use the "local vélo" if needed. 

If you are a PhD student you will have to deal with some additional burocracy :
- At the very beginnning you should enroll through the [EDPIF page](https://www.edpif.org/en/edpif/index.php), the doctoral school.
- Once obtained your phys.ens credentials, create an account on the [ADUM page](https://www.adum.fr/) for the procedures of all PhD students inscribed in France.

## I am a neo-Parisian, _au secours_
For many of these practices you will generally need to provide 
1) a French __domicile__ (see section below);
2) a French __phone number__ (some of us have FREE, but it's not a guarantee of convenience);
3) a French __bank account__ (some of us have BNP, but again it's not a guarantee).

### A house in Paris...
... it's hard to find, especially from people not on site and not speaking French. Tipically, the most effective solution is to go through networks of friends and do not hesitate too much: supply is low and demand is high.

There are some internal partnership with the university which might make it easy to find a place at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, ask how to ask for recommendations. Here is the [link](https://www.ciup.fr/demander-hebergement/) for applying.

For a flat share we suggest taking a look on the [Cartedescolocs](https://www.lacartedescolocs.fr/) or on Facebook groups ([Paris Appartement](https://www.facebook.com/groups/424628364407944) or [parischambresalouer](https://www.facebook.com/groups/parischambresalouer)), but beware because there are a lot of scums. Another page which could be worth a try is [Appartager](https://www.appartager.com/).

## I also want to work eventually
To access the Wifi `PHYS` and the LPENS clusters of the group you need to got to the `Service Informatique` (office L057 , e-mail si@phys.ens.fr).
They will register the IP of all the devices you want to use to connect which you will have to phisically bring to them. NOTE: if you want to connect via LAN and you use a toggle you will need to register that too.

## A pawn in the Doctoral School Chessboard 
The doctoral school is going to be a matrioska of institutions :
- __Université PSL__ : Paris Science et Lettres, a broad universities network in Paris ([link](https://psl.eu/en));
- __EDPIF__ : École Doctorale Physique en Île-de-France, network of physics departments in Paris ([link](https://www.edpif.org/en/edpif/index.php));
- __ENS__ : École Normale Supériere, the actual university headquartered at the 46 rue d'Ulm ([link](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en));
- __LPENS__ : Laboratoire de Physique de l'ENS, our physics department of the 24 rue Lhomond ([link](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/?lang=en));
- __statbiophys__ : this is us, we also have a website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens)!

According to your contract, you could have an extra layer of complexity given by your employer :
- __CNRS__ :
- __Sanofi__ :

## I am a grown-up-Parisian now
When you started to settle, you might start to deal with the following:
- __CAF__ 
- __public transport__  forfait Imagine R étudiant
- __responsabilité civile__ (+assurance maison?)
- __CARTE VITALE__
- __mutuelle__
